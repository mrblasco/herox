Introduction
============

Though the proportion of Internet users is nearly the same across the genders, researchers have found significant gender imbalances in online behavior:


- Only 13 percent of Wikipedia contributors are women [@hill2013wikipedia];
- Wikipedia articles on women are more likely to be missing than are articles on men relative to Britannica [@reagle2011gender];
- Less than 5 percent of StackOverflow users answering technical questions are women [@vasilescu2012gender];
- Women make a small fraction of people going to hackathons or taking part in online competitions on crowdsourcing platforms (Innocentive, TopCoder, Kaggle).

The reasons behind this gender gap are not fully understood. It is clear that it is not due to discriminatory rules put in place on these platforms. Rather the culprit seems to be a mix of psychological motivations and institutional characteristics of the platforms that might have inadvertently promoted an imbalance.

We conjecture that an important mechanism of imbalance could be the combination of

1. Gamification & incentives
2. Differences in preferences between the genders

Online platforms use elements of game play to engage their members (rankings, game points, competition with others, etc.) and stimulate higher levels of user activity. If men and women have different inclinations towards these incentives, they might inadvertently stimulate an imbalanced participation.

Role models
------------

According to the Oxford dictionary, a "role model" is a person "whose behaviour, attitudes, and/or values are seen by individuals as worthy of imitation or emulation." In economics, role models are a special case of "externality." It is also related with the notion of "peer effects," as effects xxx. Although by looking at what defines a peer, a role model may not fall in this definition.

What evidence we have about the effects of role models?  In a natural experiment at West Point, @lyle2007estimating finds a positive effect of senior cadets on junior's decisions about specialization. 

Most of empirical evidence comes from studies in social psychology; @marx2002female finds laboratory evidence consistent with a positive impact of female role models (i.e., female experimenters) on women's math test.


In academia, the importance of male professors for male students was first recognized by xxxx.  @gilbert1985dimensions finds evidence supporting the importance of female professors as role models for female students.
