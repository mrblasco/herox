Recruitment message for profiles
================================

Dear [Username],
 
We are writing to invite you to participate in a research project. As part of ongoing research into online communities, we are working with HeroX to run a field experiment investigating how the composition of online communities impacts individual behavior.

We would like to feature you in an email newsletter as a HeroX participant. A profile photo and bio would be part of a panel of 3 such profiles in the email. An example with fictional participants is shown below. To participate, you will need to provide a photograph and short biography for inclusion in the panel.

This research is being conducted by the Crowd Innovation Lab at Harvard University, http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/crowdinnovationlab/home.

As consideration for your participation, we will send you a $10 Amazon gift card.

If you are interested in participating, please go to [SURVEY URL] for complete instructions.

Thank you,
The Crowd Innovation Lab at Harvard and Hero X
