Consent for profiles
=====================

Participation is voluntary
-----------------------

It is your choice whether or not to participate in this research. If you
choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at
any time. Refusal to participate or stopping your participation will
involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise
entitled.

What is the purpose of this research?
-----------------------

As part of ongoing research into online communities, we are working with
Hero X to run a field experiment investigating how the composition of
the community impacts participation in the community across different
types of people.

How long will I take part in this research?
-----------------------

We anticipate your involvement requiring less than 1 hour of your time.

What can I expect if I take part in this research?
-----------------------

You will need to provide a suitable photograph of yourself and short
biography for use in a user profile.

What are the risks and possible discomforts?
-----------------------

Your Hero X profile will presumably receive substantially more
visibility if you decide to participate. There are no anticipated risks
to you from participation in this experiment. There are no direct
benefits to you from the research itself.

Will I be compensated for participating in this research? 
-----------------------

There are no costs to you for participation in this research study. As
consideration for your participation, we will send you a \$XXX Amazon
gift card.

If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to the information you collect? 
-----------------------

The profile information you provide will be public, as it currently is
on the Hero X website. The profile information will also be reviewed by
independent raters alongside other profiles to assess their
comparability.

Your participation in the research itself will be confidential.
Typically, only project researchers will have access to that
information. It is possible the information could be reviewed by
auditors checking to see that the research is done properly.
