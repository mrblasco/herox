	 <h1> Welcome </h1>
	 <div> 
	  <p>
	   As part of ongoing research into online communities, we are working with Hero X to run a field experiment investigating how the composition of the community impacts participation in the community. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   Ultimately, we would like to feature you in an email newsletter as a Hero X participant. 
	   A profile photo and bio would be part of a panel of 3 such profiles in the email. 
	   An example with fictional members is shown below.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   If you choose to participate, your profile will be evaluated by independent raters alongside other profiles along various dimensions. 
	   These evaluations are to ensure comparability of the selected profiles for research purposes. 
	   A subsample of profiles most suitable for the project will be used in the newsletter. 
	   Participating does not guarantee inclusion in the newsletter.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   If you would like to participate, please continue with this survey.
