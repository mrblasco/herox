Recruitment for survey (with consent)
=============================

Dear [Username],

You are one of a small number of people selected to help us improve the way HeroX functions and gain insight into how people think about crowdsourcing. Please consider this opportunity to provide valuable feedback! 

Your decision to participate in a very short survey will support a research project sponsored by the Crowd Innovation Lab at Harvard University to better understand the HeroX community of innovators, and the many reasons our members have for participating on our platform. Your participation in our survey will provide quantitative insight into what motivates our members to be involved in HeroX and to participate in our activities. 
 
Your participation in our survey will provide a quantified perspective on what motivates our members to be involved in HeroX and to participate in our activities.
 
Your viewpoint is important to the project even if you have not recently been active or have stopped participating.

The survey should not take more than 10 minutes of your time. As a token of our appreciation, you will enter a lottery to win a $10 Gift Certificate (125 in total).

Please note that children under 18 are not allowed to take part in the survey.
 
Your participation in the survey is completely voluntary and you may stop at anytime.  All responses are strictly confidential and will remain only with the researchers.
